  @Description
        This file groups the functions that implement the AUDIO library.
        The library implements functionality for generating audio using a sine of a certain frequency,
        recording and playback functionality.
        The library supports the following modes:
    Mode 0 (Generate sound using sine) - Generates sound using a sine wave. Features:
        - A fix number of sine values, covering one sine period, are stored in an array.
        - Using the sine values, PWM is produced using OC1, at a frequency of 48 kHz given by Timer3.
    Mode 1 (mirror) - Acquires samples from MIC and generates Audio output accordingly, live. Features:
        - MIC is sampled using the MIC library at a frequency of 16 kHz given by Timer3 
        - According to each acquired sample, the audio out is generated using OC1, at a frequency of 16 kHz given by Timer3.
     Mode 2 (record) - Records values acquired from MIC, saving them into a buffer. Features:
        - MIC is sampled using the MIC library at a frequency of 16 kHz given by Timer3 
        - the sampled values are placed in rgAudioBuf (which is a large static character array). 
     Mode 3 (play recorded) - Plays the values from a buffer to the Audio output. Features:
        - This function uses the samples from rgAudioBuf (which is a large static character array), stored with Record mode.
        - According to each acquired sample, the audio out is generated using OC1, at a frequency of 16 kHz given by Timer3.
    
        Include the file in the project. together with config.h, mic.c, adc.c, mic.h, adc.h when this library is needed.
        The library instantiates the rgAudioBuf, which is a large static character array, so including this library in the project uses a lot of memory.

**      Mode 0 (Generate sound using a sine wave) - Timer3 is initialized at a frequency of 48 kHz. The playback is initialized with the sine definition string.
**      Mode 1 (mirror) - The MIC module is initialized. Timer3  is initialized at a frequency of 16 kHz. 
**      Mode 2 (record) - The MIC module is initialized. Timer3 is initialized at a frequency of 16 kHz. The record is initialized with the large buffer rgAudioBuf.
**      Mode 3 (play recorded) - Timer3 is initialized at a frequency of 16 kHz. The playback is initialized with the large buffer rgAudioBuf, where eventually MIC values were stored.
**      OC1 module is configured to work with Timer3.
**      The timer period constant is computed using TMR_FREQ_SINE and TMR_FREQ_SOUND definitions (located in this source file)
**      and peripheral bus frequency definition (PB_FRQ, located in config.h).
